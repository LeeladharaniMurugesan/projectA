Notes: 
The Spring framework enables automatic dependency injection. 
In other words, by declaring all the bean dependencies in a Spring configuration file, Spring container can autowire relationships between collaborating beans. 
This is called Spring bean auto wiring.

Auto wiring has the following advantages:
• Auto wiring can significantly reduce the need to specify properties or constructor arguments. (Other mechanisms such as a bean template discussed elsewhere in this chapter are also valuable in this regard.)
• Auto wiring can update a configuration as your objects evolve. For example, if you need to add a dependency to a class, that dependency can be satisfied automatically without you needing to modify the configuration.

Thus auto wiring can be especially useful during development, without negating the option of switching to explicit wiring when the code base becomes more stable
You can combine auto wire behavior with dependency checking, which is performed after autowiring completes.
